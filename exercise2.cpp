/*Write a program to read 3 sensors data stored in a text file. Each measurement 
from 3 sensors are stored on a separate line. The first line contains the number 
of records in the file. Use dynamic memory allocation to initialize arrays. For 
example, sample data is in the following format:

3
1.22   1.44   1.55
1.44   1.45   1.67
1.24   1.46   1.56
