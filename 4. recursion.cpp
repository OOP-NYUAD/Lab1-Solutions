/*We already discussed recursion but here is a more formal definition of what is needed
for a recursive function: 
    1. A function that requires iterations calling itself
    2. A base case/terminating case that defines when the recursion stops
    3. Advancement/progress each iteration towards the base case

What happens behind the scenes is that each time a recursive call is made, the previous
calls' information gets pushed onto the call stack (memory within your computer allocated
for that process), once the recursive calls end and the returns start, the previous
information is restored and is used to resolve the next "returned" items
